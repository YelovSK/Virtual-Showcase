About the ONNX file
-------------------

The BlazeFace ONNX model was originally converted by PINTO0309 (Katsuya Hyodo).
Please refer to [his model zoo] for more information.

I (keijiro) converted his ONNX model into a Barracuda-compatible form. Please
check [this Colab notebook] for the details of the convertion process.
